Wireframe
---------

I used [moqups.com](https://moqups.com/) to make my wireframe.  Although it was very helpful, there were some aspects of my website's design that changed (like the addition of the "Pets" page).  A lot of the elements are still present however.

Unsolved Problems/ Major Hurdles
-------------

**Unsolved Problems**
The only problem I had was getting rid of a blue line in between my icon links.  I am not sure how or why it is there and tried going through my code but could not find the source.

**Major Hurdles**
Some of the of the hurdles I came across were CSS based.  My carousel would not show and it was an issue in my CSS.  At first I believed it to be a JavaScript issue but, with the help of an instructor, it was discovered to be a sizing issue in CSS.  Another hurdle I had to over come was typos.  I am learning that a small detail can through everything off.
